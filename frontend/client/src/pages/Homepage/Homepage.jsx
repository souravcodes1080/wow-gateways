            <br />
            <p>
              Its winter of 2023, and there's a rush in the hills with the huge
              inflow of tourists, but there is no systematic facilities that can
              be accessed by the tourists. From this scar in the moon, We a team
              of young enthusiastic individuals got the inspiration to change
              the scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey of WOW GATEWAYS started with the idea to solve the
              issues that the tourists were facing and to acts as a bridge
              between the tourists and the heavenly beauty of the hills. We
              always knew that if the tourism rises in our place it will
              apparently help the locals in their livelihood and other
              multifaceted way. The issues such as simple bookings,(online
              facility) tourists guide,food preferences, traveling automobiles,
              location updates, language barriers and the list is long ,were the
              things that we wanted to solve as our priority.
